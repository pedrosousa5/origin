When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?
When working in a project along with some other contributor, sharing a project.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?
Again, when you do this process manually you~re in control of whats being manipulated, you can decide for yourself what's important and need to be updated.

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use one instead of another?
Forks are copies with GitHub - you might copy (clone) a repository from GitHub directly to another GitHub Repository (remote).
Clones are copies made from gitHub to your local computer, basically dowloading a repository from Github.
Branch is a work flow, so every repository has at least one branch (master) but many can be created for many different reasons in the same depository.
A fork is used when you are editing someone's already started work so you're allowed to fork it to your repository and and then you can edit and submit your changes (commits).
A clone is the process of bringing it to you local machine to work on the files that can't be updated straight from Github (code).
A branch is when you have a new feature on your project and you want to keep the master intact while working on that new feature or and experimental change.
