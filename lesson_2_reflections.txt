What happens when you initialize a repository?
Git creates a folder named .git for the commits meta data.

Why do you need to do it?
To keep track of our files history - commits.



How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? What value do you think it offers?
The Staging area is where the files selected by you from your Working Directory to have their history saved on your next commit, so that information will then be saved in your Repository.
A great value of the Staging are is that you may select which files from your working directory will be used on your next commit, it gives you control of which files you want to take a snapshot (commit) at that point which means it might be a single file or even the whole lot of files in your working directory.

How can you use the staging area to make sure you have one commit per logical change?
by adding to the it only the affected files on that particular change, so when you commit, it will only have files related to the curretn Logical Change.
